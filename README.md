# LipNet

LipNet is a deep neural network for visual speech recognition. It was created by Yannis Assael, 
Brendan Shillingford, Shimon Whiteson and Nando de Freitas, researchers from the University of Oxford. 
This technique, as outlined in a paper in November 2016, is able to decode text from the movement of a speaker's mouth.
